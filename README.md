### What is it?
Vue Todo is a simple TODO list that allows:

- Generation of  fake elements
- Searching elements
- Deleting and inserting elements

I used this project for testing purposes related to JavaScript timings in managing more elements, in the end I found that JavaScript is very fast.


### Get started
To use this project you need to have Node installed. 
Then execute these commands in the project directory:
```javascript
npm install
npm run serve
```
The last command will start the project on `localhost:8080`.
